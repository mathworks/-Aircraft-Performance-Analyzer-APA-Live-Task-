## Introduction

The APA Live Task lets you interactively analyze the performance of your electric fixed-wing aircraft design. These performance insights help you further optimize the design against the design requirements.
This live task offers multiple performance analysis capabilities:
1. Power requirements:  Required power, max. available power, drag vs. speed, max speed, min drag speed, stall speeds for various operations
2. Range and Endurance: Rangevs. speed, endurance vs. speed, and speeds for max range and max endurance
3. Take-off: Various take-off phases and total take-off distance
4. Landing: Various landing phases and total landing distance
   
Additionally,
-   you can export the [Aero.FixedWing](https://in.mathworks.com/help/aerotbx/ug/aero.fixedwing-class.html) object for further pursuing stability analysis.
-   you can edit the generated code and extend the performance analysis as per your requiremts.
